# RoomJavaWithAsyncTask
This project is a simple example of a single entity crud using ORM Room with SQLite asynchronous persistence with Java language.

If you use this project as an example, please give credit as it has taken a lot of work to find a working internet example with Asynctask.

In addition to having persistence with ROOM using java, this project also has an example of offline login that can be validated before making the network call by saving login data to SQLite.
